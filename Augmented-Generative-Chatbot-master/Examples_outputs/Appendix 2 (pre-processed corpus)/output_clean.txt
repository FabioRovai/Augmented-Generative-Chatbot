 Expand Hobs Studio Londons HereEast campus.

In an industry where alleged groundbreaking solutions and world firsts are ten a penny and the word evangelist is thrown around often it can be very easy to become cynical  though Id take that over another mention of a Star Trek replicator any day. But when you meet someone who has a genuine passion for not only their job but the impact that they can have on the wider industry and generation its hard not to be infected by their positivity and vigour for the technology. That is exactly what happened to me when I was introduced to Kadine James of Hobs Studio last month.

I speak to James as the 3D Tech Lead for the UKs largest 3D printing bureau is gearing up to host the first Women in 3D Printing regional meetup at the studios HereEast home inside Londons Olympic Park. The event is part of a growing network of chapters and events spun out of the group founded by Nora Toure to encourage more women to get involved and share their stories from the 3D printing industry.

Kadine James 3D Tech Lead at Hobs Studio

Im on a mission with Nora and other incredible women across the globe to increase visibility around 3D printing so that we can get more women into 3D printing technologies get them using 3D printing and equally create a platform to support and amplify an agenda around digital skills and digital disruption and get more women from diverse backgrounds into the maker community James explained giving you just a sense of her enthusiasm for digital diversity.

Yet leading the UKs Women in 3D Printing chapter is merely the most recent addition to James stacked CV who spends her time engaging with young people as a STEM ambassador working on digital inclusion and diversity workshops and being actively involved in local initiatives such as the Smart London Camp to harness the citys digital talents.

In her day job James works closely with leading architects engineers and creatives to create content with a range of digital technologies including 3D printing virtual reality VR and augmented reality AR. The studio works with artists like Grayson Perry and the Antony Gormley studio AJ Architects Journal Top 100 architects such as Foster  Partners Zaha Hadid Architects and also on major master planning projects currently two of the biggest in Europe where Hobs has produced the largest 3D printed masterplan in the UK at 3.6 x 2.6 x 1 m for Barking Riversides new 10000 home development. Its also currently working with Peabody one of the UKs oldest social housing providers on the regeneration of the Thamesmead New Town which will see over 2500 new homes built over the next ten years.

They are using these technologies in a way that to my mind hasnt been used before by any other social housing provider James explained. Theyre really grabbing these opportunities to connect with communities in and around place making and wider community engagement around how cities are built how place making is part of the public realm.

Community engagement plays a major role in much Hobs work not only communicating with stakeholders councillors MPs and politicians via digital platforms but also the communities which will ultimately live work and play in these environments once they become a reality. Taking this a step further the bureau is also launching a 3D Academy in a bid to build a pool of 3D talent from across the UK that will equip the next generation and upskill the current workforce with skills for the future whether thats data CAD 3D printing or beyond.

This isnt just about tech companies this is about all companies James elaborated. As technology continues to grow and expand everybody needs to in my view be thinking about upskilling their workforce and were very focussed on promoting that agenda in particular for the UK.

Last year the UKs additive manufacturing AM community was left understandably disheartened by the lack of AM in the UK Governments Industrial Strategy plans to steer the industry. James believes that in order for the UKs economy to succeed digital and data skills are going to be at the centre of creating a more resilient workforce. To spearhead this change Hobs has recently been working with students on training programmes around digital product design digital data and 3D printing with The London Legacy Development Corporation to help foster these skills.

Hobs works across multiple disciplines including virtual reality shown here in the VRCUB3D.

I also think in the next century we are going to be encountering more rapid change that is going to underpin how we employ people but its also going to have a huge impact on the labour market James commented. Automisation is going to be fundamental in terms of driving that change and with 3D printed houses and robots and all of the technology that is being used across the built environment and across the worlds of fashion engineering all of these workflows are going to be focussed around digital and data.

Hobs Studio was an early adopter of 3D printing and specialises in full colour stereolithography and multijet 3D printing across its four Hobs 3D sites in London Manchester Bristol and Glasgow. Yet 3D printing is just one part of that story and the studio works across many different disciplines to maximise data in the most effective way possible whether that means flying a plane over a redevelopment area to create a 3D model or using a popup VRCUB3D to enable residents to immerse themselves in a future built environment.

Its all about the data all about ways we can maximise that data right the way through to laser scanning 3D modelling and also our 3D visualisation studio where we are creating VR and AR experiences and overlaying digital models in real time which is just mind blowing.

Hobs Studio is set to host the second Women in 3D Printing London meetup on June 5th and is encouraging both users and newcomers of the technology to attend and share knowledge something which James is striving to do day in day out.

James added I want to use my platform and really use that as a powerful way to connect with communities that we work in and amplify the agenda around future skills digital inclusion women in technology and ways that we can create sustainable economies socially and economically.

Kadine how did you get into tech industry Tell us a bit more about your background and your projects so far.

My background is in creative arts I studied Art and Design and have always been fascinated with tech and how it can be used to create and make there are quite literally endless possibilities. At our digital foundry and makers lab in East London we are pioneering the use of 3D printing technology alongside Virtual Reality. We are on a mission to support the best cuttingedge and creative startups and are driving Hobs 3D commercial cultural and educational impact initiatives. We are working across multiple industries including architecture engineering fashion education master planning and the arts. Our VR artist in residence Hallidonto is developing new works here at our studios through the use of Tilt Brush which lets you paint in 3D space with Virtual Reality. The aim of this project is to promote and explore the convergence of 21stcentury technology in the form of immersive VR with traditional Art practice embodying notions of the classical with contemporary immersive and interactive technology.

My work is also focused on planning and the urban environment the city and urban change. Our VR studios have recently taken Thamesmead Londons New Town one of the biggest master planning projects in Europe into Virtual Reality we are using new technologies that support greater community engagement in design embracing new tech to win the confidence of communities before a single brick has been laid. Through VR we are able to visualise proposed new housing from neighbour of home buyers perspective with communities being able to see how a development can visually contribute to the area from a very early stage and even before planning permission has been granted.

What does your current job role entail

I am the 3D Tech Lead at Hobs 3D Hobs 3D is unique in providing a range of highquality 3D solutions for architecture construction engineering and property development along with working with worldleading contemporary artists and creatives at our digital foundry and makers lab . Our specialists use the latest technologies in 3D printing 3D Laser Scanning and 3D Visualisations VRARMR and deep tech to support our clients in their design process.

Hobs 3D is also the UKs largest 3D printing bureau we have recently chosen Here East as our new London headquarters. Here East is already home to Plexal Loughborough University London and BT Sport. Along with Sports Interactive and Ladbrokes Coral who are also relocating to Here East campus. Ford Motors is set to open its European Smart Mobility Office and luxury fashion retailer MATCHESFASHION.COM has lined up new photography and filming studios.

We moved to Here East as we wanted to be part of East Londons thriving creative scene. Here East was the natural choice for our new headquarters as we looked to expand in the years ahead. We are looking forward to our affiliation with the Digital Engineering and Test Centre DETC and we are already collaborating with other tenants at Here East including Loughborough University and UCL. Our 3D academy with London Legacy and The Mayor of London seeks to reinforce core STEAM subjects along with creating social and economic opportunities and pathways into tech jobs.

How long did it take you to be where you are now

I have been working in 3D printingVRARMR for over 6 years prior to that I worked in the creative industries with roles in Music and The Arts. I love to collaborate and have the privilege of being able to work across multiple industries this includes working with architects artists storytellers makers and innovators  which is incredibly exciting. I also want to make sure that I pass the baton on to the next generation by supporting young people and especially young women that are interested in careers in technology STEAM. Recently I have had the enriching experience of working with some extremely talented young people as part of the Flipside program. The tech sector in London admits that it is still difficult to find enough people who have the right skills and PostBrexit it has become really important to train local talent in the skills that the UK growing tech sector requires. Where I am based over at Here Easts Creative Cluster in East London we have a fantastic combination of young creative people alongside a highly successful ecosystem of creative digital agencies makers academics and tech startups.

We are also about to launch our very own digital skills academy with the Mayor of London and LLDC at Hobs 3D it is my aim to continue to connect local people to Tech career opportunities coming forward on the Queen Elizabeth Park and the wider areas across London.

What was the biggest obstacle

All women should have the selfbelief to put themselves forward and make their voices heard. How else will we inspire the next generation of women if we dont set the examples ourselves Another thing is to not be afraid to try new ways of working. Its often on the untraveled path that we can discover the most exciting and interesting opportunities. Thats where ideas can take shape and evolve and where big breakthroughs happen both emotionally and professionally. I would also highly recommend worrying less and being kind to yourself and everyone you interact with spread positivity and embrace change.

What are your biggest achievements to date

I have been very fortunate to work on so many exciting projects throughout my career in disruptive technology recently with the portrait Artist Jonathan Yeo Britain leading contemporary portraitist. Jonathan has recently created his first three dimensional work The worlds first sculpture selfportrait designed by hand in Virtual Reality and then cast in bronze.

We are also working with AI Build a London based technology company focusing of large scale 3D printing using industrial robots and artificial intelligence to make in ways that were not too long ago were completely unimaginable.

Launching the UK Chapter of Women in 3D printing with Win3DP Founder Nora Toure has also been such an inspiring experience. Women in 3D Printing is an organisation dedicated to promoting supporting and inspiring women who are using Additive Manufacturing technologies. We are on a mission is to increase the visibility of women in the Additive Manufacturing industry and encourage more women to use 3D Printing technologies. I am also really looking forward to our potential collaboration with WoW next year

I have enjoyed making the transition to the Olympic Park at Here East this has been so inspiring due to the size of campus and the opportunities to collide and connect across tech academia and with the arts and culture district thats coming East with the VA East UAL and Sadlers Wells all joining us the potential social and economic impact that this ecosystem will have will be immense.

What does the WomenInTech movement mean to you What are the challenges of being a woman in 3D  STEM

There are no selfderived challenges to being a female leader my view is that women truly can do anything that they set their minds too in this world  and the list of our physical and intellectual capabilities is as long if not longer than men. That being said society is still adjusting itself to the dynamism ambition and creativity of women and women must cultivate personal resilience to adversity in the face of the sexism and inequality however subtle or overt we still experience.

I tend to focus on my own goals and hope that my projects and achievements stand for themselves as testament to my abilities. Surrounding yourself with a supportive and diverse team and staying close to other women in business and technology is an important force of inspiration for me.

In your opinion what will be the key trends in the 3D and STEM industry in the next 5 years and where do you see it heading

Application Driven

Recent developments in Additive Manufacturing have focused on building better faster larger and more capable machines and on extending the range of new materials. And while its important to continue to innovate and increase manufacturing capabilities the real transformative power of 3D Printing will not be unleashed by simply building bigger and better machines. The key to unlocking the next industrial transformation will be our true understanding of which applications benefit most from AM technology. In the future machines and software will become more and more specialized and applicationdriven to meet very specific customer and industry demands. The potential is huge and very exciting.

Automation

As 3D printing technologies are continuing to mature the focus will turn towards streamlining pre and postproduction processes. While a large segment of 3Dprinted production tools and prototypes are ready for use nearly straight out of the machine with minimal finishing theres also a huge number of endparts that require complex finishing processes. This is not only laborintensive but also costintensive.

Industrial automation in the form of pickandplace robotics has the potential to drastically raise efficiency by cutting both postproduction time and costs. Pair that with software knowhow and I envision an automated postproduction system that ensures traceability and speed without overreliance on manual intervention. Software will also increasingly play a role in the automation of preproduction steps as illustrated by the recent surge in interest in simulation software which is mostly driven by the rising adoption of Metal 3D Printing.

While Metal 3D Printing has already proven its vast potential for time and costsavings the cost of wasted material due to build fails quickly becomes unaffordable and I expect simulation software will play an increasingly important role in predicting failures before they happen.

Integration

In the last few years we have seen 3D Printing claiming its position in supply chains. With faster lead times and toolingfree production 3D Printing has proven to be a valuable technology for those applications that are traditionally resourceintensive. It also leads to leaner supply chains and fewer stock risks. 3D Printing will steadily increase its value in manufacturing supply chains in two ways by enabling the creation of digital supply chains which hold the promise of transforming entire business models such as the hearing aid and eyewear industry and by becoming more integrated in existing supply chains.

Collaboration

Collaboration is key to expanding 3D Printing to manufacturing industries. Increasing collaboration between existing players such as hardware software and service providers will lead to optimised and easiertointegrate product offerings which will fuel adoption with more collaboration between the 3D printing industry and its customers.

Metal 3D printing

Metal 3D printing is developing rapidly both in terms of lowering costs and increased adoption Metal 3D Printing will never replace traditional manufacturingbut as a complimentary manufacturing technology its position is becoming increasingly important. Looking forward Metal 3D Printing will become more and more of a necessity when solving specific manufacturing challenges and creating customized complex enduse products.

I am also excited to watch how things develop with the Lunar project. Foster  Partners are part of a consortium set up by the European Space Agency to explore the possibilities of 3D printing to construct lunar habitations. The practice has designed a lunar base to house four people which can offer protection from meteorites gamma radiation and high temperature fluctuations.

This project is groundbreaking in demonstrating the potential of 3D printing to create structures that are close to natural biological systems.

The Immersive economy in the UK has grown considerably with Immersive technologies like virtual reality VR and augmented reality AR making a move from gaming into other areas like architecture engineering and property. Immersive technologies and Rapid Prototyping could help the UK to increase productivity if barriers are overcome. Key policy initiatives such as the Industrial Strategy Challenge Funds 33 million investment in audiences of the future and commitment to the sector from key networks such as Innovate UK the Digital Catapults the High Value Manufacturing Catapult and research councils have a vital role to play in this process.

Nora Toure Kadine could you let us know about your background and what brought you into 3D printing in the first place

Kadine James My background is in art and design I have always been interested in tech and the use of digital tools and how the technologies of our time are being used across many disciplines when the opportunity came about to work at the biggest 3D printing company in the UK I jumped at it.

I love good design along with the making and fabrication process. Additive Fabrication is one of those rare technologies that although 20 years old is just coming into its own. In the beginning the models were fragile and brittle and could only be used for form but now with improved plastics binders and even metals you can create a very robust enduse part. And when you begin to consider the wide array of other materials that can ultimately be used I believe the potential is endless.
