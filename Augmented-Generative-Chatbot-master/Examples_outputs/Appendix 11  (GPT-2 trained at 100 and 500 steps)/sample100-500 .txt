. In addition to these three focal points across digital product design digital transformation and content creation we are also working with artists and creatives to create content with a range of digital technologies including 3D printing virtual reality VR and augmented reality AR. We are also releasing new VR and Mixed Reality content every month and we are already working with leading architects on new master planning projects. We are also working with leading music artists and VR producers to create content with a range of digital technologies including 3D printing virtual reality VR and augmented reality AR.

This is not only about cost its also about trying to maximise efficiency by moving as many jobs as possible from London to the East of the city. What does your current job role entail I am the 3D Tech Lead at Hobs 3D Hobs 3D is unique in providing a range of highquality 3D solutions for architecture construction engineering and property development along with working with leading international galleries leading contemporary artists architects and sets out to create a platform for 3D printing VRARMR learning opportunities for young people to get involved with 3DTech in East London at Hobs 3D and share in the rewards of being a part of this exciting industry. We are also the UKs largest 3D printing bureau we have recently chosen Here East as our new London headquarters. Here East is already home to Plexal Loughborough University London and BT Sport. Along with Sports Interactive and Ladbrokes Coral who are also relocating to Here East campus. Ford Motors is set to open its European Smart Mobility Office and luxury fashion retailer MATCHESFASHION.com has lined up new photography and filming studios. We moved to Here East as we wanted to be part of East Londons thriving creative scene. Here East was the natural choice for our new headquarters as we looked to expand in the years ahead. We are looking forward to our affiliation with the Digital Engineering and Test Centre DETC and we are already collaborating with other tenants at Here East including Loughborough University and UCL. Our 3D academy with London Legacy and The Mayor of London seeks to reinforce core STEAM subjects along with creating social and economic opportunities and pathways into tech jobs. How long did it take you to be where you are now I have been working in 3D printingVRARMR for over 6 years prior to that I worked in the creative industries with roles in Music and The Arts. I love to collaborate and have the privilege of being able to work across multiple industries this includes working with architects artists storytellers makers and innovators which is incredibly exciting. I also want to make sure that I pass the baton on to the next generation by supporting young people and especially young women that are interested in careers in technology STEAM. Recently I have had the enriching experience of working with some extremely talented young people as part of the Flipside program. The tech sector in London admits that it is still difficult to find enough people who have the right skills and PostBrexit it has become really important to train local talent in the skills that the UK growing tech sector requires. Where I am based over at Here Easts Creative Cluster in East London we have a fantastic combination of young creative people alongside a highly successful ecosystem of creative digital agencies makers academics and tech startups. We are also about to launch our very own digital skills academy with the Mayor of London and LLDC at Hobs 3D it is my aim to continue to connect local people to Tech career opportunities coming forward on the Queen Elizabeth Park and the wider areas across London. What was the biggest obstacle All women should have the selfbelief to put themselves forward and make their voices heard. How else will we inspire the next generation of women if we dont set the examples ourselves Another thing is to not be afraid to try new ways of working. Its often on the untraveled path that we can discover the most exciting and interesting opportunities. Thats where ideas can take shape and evolve and where big breakthroughs happen both emotionally and professionally. I would also highly recommend worrying less and being kind to yourself and everyone you interact with spread positivity and embrace change.

This isnt just about tech companies this is about all companies James elaborated. As technology continues to grow and expand everybody needs to in my view be thinking about upskilling their workforce and were very focussed on promoting that agenda in particular for the UK.

Last year the UKs additive manufacturing AM community was left understandably awestruck by the lack of AM in the UK Governments Industrial Strategy plans to steer the industry. James believes that in order for the UKs economy to succeed digital and data skills are going to be at the centre of creating a more resilient workforce. To spearhead this change Hobs has recently been working with students on training programmes around digital product design digital data and 3D printing with The London Legacy Development Corporation to help foster these skills.

Hobs works across multiple disciplines including virtual reality shown here in the VRCUB3D.

I also think in the next century we are going to be encountering more rapid change that is going to underpin how we employ people but James believes that in order for us to succeed digital and data skills are going to be at the centre of creating a more resilient workforce. To spearhead this change Hobs has recently been working with students on training programmes around digital product design digital data and 3D printing with The London Legacy Development Corporation to help foster these skills.

I have been very fortunate to work on so many exciting projects throughout my career in disruptive technology recently with the portrait Artist Jonathan Yeo Britain leading contemporary portraitist. Jonathan has recently created his first three dimensional work The worlds first sculpture selfportrait designed by hand in Virtual Reality and then cast in bronze.

We are also working with AI Build a London based technology company focusing of large scale 3D printing using industrial robots and artificial intelligence which make in ways that were not too long ago were completely unimaginable.

Launching the UK Chapter of Women in 3D printing with Win3DP Founder Nora Toure has also been such an inspiring experience. Women in 3D Printing is
